Currently pursuing a PhD under Prof. Farzad Kamalabadi, my research is focused on the implications of commonly used model assumptions on traditional estimation techniques.

My first papers were focused on the powerful implications of a space-invariant prior, resulting in a linear improvement in estimation quality as a function of the number of parameters being estimated. While still working on that direction, my current research is focused on dynamical system forecasting.
